# 🧠 Comprehensive Women Safety EcoSystem – Multi-Modal Safety Infrastructure

This is a comprehensive, multi-layered project designed to enhance women’s safety using a combination of **AI surveillance**, **mobile application**, and **IoT wearable technology**. The system aims to monitor, detect, and alert during suspicious or emergency situations using smart automation and human-centered design.

## 🔍 Overview

> The Women Safety System consists of three key modules, each solving a unique problem in the safety ecosystem:

| Module               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AI CCTV System**    | Real-time person detection, gender classification & smart alerts via CCTV  |
| **Her Guardian App**  | Mobile safety app with heatmaps, SOS triggers & ML risk assessment         |
| **IoT Wearable**      | Smartwatch prototype to detect biometric anomalies & send real-time alerts |
